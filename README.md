This is the official repository for implementation of https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04039 (Accepted at AIIDE 2021 (Oral) !!)

# What is this?

Plug-and-Blend introduce blending control to your continuation model and grants high-level planning capabilities to it. Great for generating stories, designed with co-creativity in mind and will benefit other PCG applications.

# If you are curious, see the demo now!

(Hint: Don't forget to switch Runtime Type to GPU - Or generating a sentence will take a minute!)
